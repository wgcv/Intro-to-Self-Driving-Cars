    "1. Run the cell below this one by pressing `Ctrl + Enter`\n",
    "2. Click the button that says \"Launch Car Simulator\". A new tab should open in your browser.\n",
    "3. Arrange your tabs as shown below so that this notebook is on one side of the screen and the simulator is on the other. ![code next to simulator](https://i.imgur.com/zhPjERi.jpg)\n",
    "4. Run the cell (`Ctrl + Enter`) marked \"CODE CELL\". The car in the simulator should start moving. You should notice a problem...\n",
    "5. Press the **Reset** button in the simulator and then modify the code in the code cell. You should only need to change one line of code...\n",
    "6. When you think you've fixed the problem, run the code cell again. Did the car make it over the trees?"
